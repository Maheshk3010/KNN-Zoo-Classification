 🐾 KNN Zoo Classification

 📌 Project Overview
This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm to classify animal types using the Zoo dataset.

The objective is to evaluate KNN performance and understand how the choice of K affects classification accuracy.

 📂 Dataset
- Dataset: Zoo.csv
- Features: 16 animal characteristics
- Target: Animal type classification

---

 ⚙️ Steps Performed

1. Data Loading and Basic Exploration
2. Checked for Missing Values
3. Removed unnecessary columns (animal name)
4. Train-Test Split (80% training, 20% testing)
5. Feature Scaling using StandardScaler
6. KNN Model Training
7. Model Evaluation using:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-score
8. Hyperparameter tuning (Different K values)
9. Decision Boundary Visualization (2 features)

---

 🤖 Model Used
- K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
- Distance Metric: Euclidean Distance
- Optimal K chosen after comparison

---

 📊 Results
The classifier performed well on the testing dataset.  
Different K values were tested to identify the most suitable neighbor count.
